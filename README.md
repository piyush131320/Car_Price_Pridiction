# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of used cars using Machine Learning algorithms. The model is trained on historical car data and learns patterns based on features such as fuel type, present price, kilometers driven, number of owners, year of manufacture, and transmission type.

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate car prices and help users make informed buying or selling decisions.
